## About

This demo showcases single-view 3D reconstructions of real ships, predicted by a model trained entirely on synthetic data.  
It allows users to interactively explore 3D point clouds of segmented ships aligned with their real-world geolocation using MapLibre and Three.js.

All input images, segmentation masks, 3D reconstructions, and metadata are precomputed and served directly via this static site.
